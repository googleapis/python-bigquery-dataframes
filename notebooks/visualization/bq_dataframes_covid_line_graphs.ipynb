For our first graph, we're going to recreate one of those charts by filtering,  summing, and then graphing COVID-19 data from the United States. BigQuery DataFrame's default integration with matplotlib will get us a satisfying result for this first graph.\n",

Our second graph will be of symptom-related search trends against new cases of COVID-19, so we'll see if searches for things like \"cough\" and \"fever\" are more common in the places and times where more new cases of COVID-19 occur."
