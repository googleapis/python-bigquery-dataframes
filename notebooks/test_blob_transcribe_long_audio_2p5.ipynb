No man could get into the celestial kingdom without a wife, because he's only half there if he hasn't got a wife. And no woman, of course, could get there without a husband either, because she's only half there. Well, now at that time, the Mormons were very strict, uh, uh, religious people, you see. Sure. Sure. And, uh, thought that a man had to live clean all his life as well as a woman did in order to be worthy to be a man. Well, this is still true. Well, it's still true certainly. But I said, in that those circumstances, at that time, there were, uh, about three times as many women that joined the church and were faithful Latter-day Saints than there were men. When Joseph Smith comes out with the revelation that, uh, marriage was for eternity. And if if you're going to be separated from death do you part, then you can't get into the celestial kingdom at all to become as God is. Now, they got that doctrine. And that was, the prophet said that, they believed that. What about these here two-thirds of the women? Yeah, that's a good question. What is going to become of us then? It won't do us any good to go out here and marry one of these scallywags that spends his time drinking and boozing around and mining and maybe works in the mine a while and does all kind of skullduggery. That won't do us any good to marry that kind of a man. Besides, we don't have a chance to raise a respectable family with that kind of a man. So, what are we going to do about it now? What's going to become of us? And Joseph Smith always prayed about every problem that came to him. And there's where he got the revelation that if they live thoroughly clean and faithful, if they can understand the purity and sacredness of sex, so they don't desecrate it, then one man can have a number of wives and and permit them to raise a respectable, honorable family as well as have those wives throughout eternity, have their husband to take them into the celestial kingdom.
