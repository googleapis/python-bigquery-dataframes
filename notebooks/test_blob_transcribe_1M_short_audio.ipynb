No man could get into the celestial kingdom without a wife, because he's only half there if he hasn't got a wife. And no woman, of course, could get there without a husband either, because she's only half there. Well, now at that time, the Mormons were very strict, uh, uh, religious people, you see. Sure. Sure. And, uh, thought that a man had to live clean all his life as well as a woman did in order to be worthy to be a man. Well, this is still true. Well, it's still true certainly. But I said, in that those circumstances, at that time, there were, uh, about three times as many women that joined the church and were faithful Latter-day Saints than there were men. When Joseph Smith comes out with the revelation that, uh, marriage was for eternity. And if if you're going to be separated from death do you part, then you can't get into the celestial kingdom at all to become as God is. Now, they got that doctrine. And that was, the prophet said that, they believed that. What about these here two-thirds of the women? Yeah, that's a good question. What is going to become of us then? It won't do us any good to go out here and marry one of these scallywags that spends his time drinking and boozing around and mining and maybe works in the mine a while and does all kind of skullduggery. That won't do us any good to marry that kind of a man. Besides, we don't have a chance to raise a respectable family with that kind of a man. So, what are we going to do about it now? What's going to become of us? And Joseph Smith always prayed about every problem that came to him. And there's where he got the revelation that if they live thoroughly clean and faithful, if they can understand the purity and sacredness of sex, so they don't desecrate it, then one man can have a number of wives and and permit them to raise a respectable, honorable family as well as have those wives throughout eternity, have their husband to take them into the celestial kingdom.

Mhm. They surround at a certain place and they drag the net. They surround it, you mean they carry the net out? Carry the net, uh-huh. Uh, how do they is there something to keep the net floating? Yeah, some they have those floaters uh floating. Mhm. Some they have a lead down at the bottom, then they drag that uh net in. What do the floats what are the floats made of? The float made of those uh some coconut uh dry coconut I guess. Oh, dry coconut. That's a good use for coconut. Uh, and that floats the top of the net. Top of the net. Now, the word lau means leaf, doesn't it? Lau, lau is a yeah, yeah, lau is a leaf. All right, well now the the where does the leaf come in in this Hukilau? Hukilau, the leaves, you know, they stay on at the top top of the rope. So that the when they pull, the fish going to not to jump over the rope. The ropes, the the uh the leaves keep the fish from jumping over to the Jump over. They scare they scare them away so they want to go underneath the water, see. When moment she go underneath the water there, they will go to the net. They have a pocket on the net. They have a pocket on the net. Now the bottom of the net then Bottom of the net they have a pocket in. Mhm. The the bottom must have some kind of things to make it sink. Sink is a lead, they have a lead. Oh, they have lead on it. I see. Then uh uh somebody goes out and puts the net out around. Yeah, they throw it with a boat. With a boat? Two two boats they goes out. Throw it all around. And then uh who pulls it in? Well, they have a lots of uh from the shore about 40, 50 guys they pull that rope up. Ah, I see. Yeah. And uh they must have a pretty big school of fish there. Yeah, once in a while they have a nice school school, right? And then they pull them all in and the fish don't are scared to jump out so they get caught. No, they all in up on the net already. Mhm. They get caught in the net. I suppose the top of the net comes in sooner than the bottom so they if they do try to go out there, that's pocket. Yeah, they have to they going to, you know, about six or seven guys is swimming on it around the net to they're watching how the fish going. Oh, I see. They they're chasing at the hole. Uh-huh.
