        "1. Use PaLM2TextEmbeddingGenerator to [generate text embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/embeddings/get-text-embeddings) for each of 5000 complaints sent to an online bank. If you're not familiar with what a text embedding is, it's a list of numbers that are like coordinates in an imaginary \"meaning space\" for sentences. (It's like [word embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding), but for more general text.) The important point for our purposes is that similar sentences are close to each other in this imaginary space.\n",
        "2. Use KMeans clustering to group together complaints whose text embeddings are near to eachother. This will give us sets of similar complaints, but we don't yet know _why_ these complaints are similar.\n",
        "3. Prompt PaLM2TextGenerator in English asking what the difference is between the groups of complaints that we got. Thanks to the power of modern LLMs, the response might give us a very good idea of what these complaints are all about, but remember to [\"understand the limits of your dataset and model.\"](https://ai.google/responsibility/responsible-ai-practices/#:~:text=Understand%20the%20limitations%20of%20your%20dataset%20and%20model)\n",

They accepted and when I called back approximately two weeks later, Ocwen told me very rudely that they can not accept my request for workout assistance because the owner of the loan does not participate in modifications. They are not offering me any sort of options to foreclosure. How can the investor not abide by California laws designed to help people who are in distress. Also, each time I call Ocwen they are very rude and I have asked for Spanish speaking agents and they flat out tell me there is none. I believe Ocwen is headquartered XXXX and they simply do not understand Ca laws, nor that they are discriminating against people like me who feel more comfortable to speak in native tongue.\n",

We ended up moving from XXXX Texas to XXXX and sold the home. During closing a payoff amount was requested and we contacted them to notify that the loan would close on XX/XX/XXXX and the payment for XX/XX/XXXX would be included in the payoff amount. A represenative told us this was normal practice and so we went on to close the loan on the XX/XX/XXXX. Once the loan was closed and paid in full, we began looking for a new home in our new XXXX of XXXX. Come to find out our credit had been dinged badly due to Freedom Mortgage saying we had missed XXXX payments!!! WHAT?? I immediately got on the phone to find out what was going on. After countless phone calls and talking to representatives and waiting for supervisor call backs ... .still they can not put me through to anyone who has the authority to look into the matter and realize that NO payments were missed and the loan is closed and paid in Full!! This has prevented us from looking for and applying for a new mortgage. This is by far the worst handling of a situation where a client who has always been in good standing and has completely paid their loan in full, is being completely discredited by a mistake from their company!! It completely disrupts peoples lives!!\n",
            "5. My USDA mortgage loan is currently serviced by Carrington Mortgage Services ( CMS ). CMS claims that the total amount past due is {$14000.00}. The alleged claim is for 14 payments. CMS alleges that {$3400.00} were transferred in late fees from XXXX. XXXX has advised there were no late fees compiled when the loan was transferred in XX/XX/XXXX. CMS is clearly trying to over collect on the amount due, so they can push the bill to the USDA for payment. I have also applied for a loan modification on numerous occasions and CMS has refused to submit the modification requests for underwriting to the USDA. Since the USDA is the investor and insures the loan, they would be issuing a partial claim to help fund the loan modification. Since the USDA is unaware of the partial claim, they were clearly in the dark on the loan modification process. CMS is in clear violation of the False Claims Act ( FCA ), 31 USC 3729 - 3733, since they knowingly withheld information and reported false records to a Federal Government Agency. CMS also has an obligation to process the loan modification with transparency and clarity per the National Mortgage Settlement of XX/XX/XXXX. CMS has refused to cooperate and has set a foreclosure sale date of XX/XX/XXXX. Based on the violations listed herein, I am seeking your assistance on this matter.\n",

For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.

This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain  access under this subchapter.\n",

            "1. On or about XXXX XXXX, 2016, I submitted to my servicer a loan modification request. They accepted and when I called back approximately two weeks later, Ocwen told me very rudely that they can not accept my request for workout assistance because the owner of the loan does not participate in modifications. They are not offering me any sort of options to foreclosure. How can the investor not abide by California laws designed to help people who are in distress. Also, each time I call Ocwen they are very rude and I have asked for Spanish speaking agents and they flat out tell me there is none. I believe Ocwen is headquartered XXXX and they simply do not understand Ca laws, nor that they are discriminating against people like me who feel more comfortable to speak in native tongue.\n",
            "2. I have a mortgage loan which is interest only and the balance is {$700000.00}. The interest rate is 5.75 and since the real estate market crash of XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX I have been trying to get it refinanced to the much lower rates that mortgages have been at since then. My mortgage lender is Bank of America. Everytime I have asked them to refinance the loan, they say that my debt/income ratio is high and they can not do it. \n",
            "\n",
            "That is ridicules since for the past 9 years I have been able to make my payments at 5.75 % rate and they tell me that I do n't qualify to make the payments at 3 to 3.5 % rates. \n",
            "\n",
            "Of course by delaying this matter for years they have benefited nicely by collecting 5.75 % on a good size mortgage.\n",
            "3. I have signed the refinance paperwork with PrimeChoiceFunding Mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX for a XXXX  days lock based on the advertisement flyer that came in the mail in XXXX of XXXX. As of today XX/XX/XXXX XXXX 3 months later ) I have not received any updates on my closing date and have not been able to receive any updates on the status of my file. It is misleading to keep the consumer on hold for such a long period of time with no updates and no end date after offering a XXXX  days lock in. It is a desperate situation. Please assist.\n",
            "4. Our loan had been transferred to Freedom Mortgage, we were on a biweekly payment plan as we wanted to payoff the loan faster. We ended up moving from XXXX Texas to XXXX and sold the home. During closing a payoff amount was requested and we contacted them to notify that the loan would close on XX/XX/XXXX and the payment for XX/XX/XXXX would be included in the payoff amount. A represenative told us this was normal practice and so we went on to close the loan on the XX/XX/XXXX. Once the loan was closed and paid in full, we began looking for a new home in our new XXXX of XXXX. Come to find out our credit had been dinged badly due to Freedom Mortgage saying we had missed XXXX payments!!! WHAT?? I immediately got on the phone to find out what was going on. After countless phone calls and talking to representatives and waiting for supervisor call backs ... .still they can not put me through to anyone who has the authority to look into the matter and realize that NO payments were missed and the loan is closed and paid in Full!! This has prevented us from looking for and applying for a new mortgage. This is by far the worst handling of a situation where a client who has always been in good standing and has completely paid their loan in full, is being completely discredited by a mistake from their company!! It completely disrupts peoples lives!!\n",
            "5. My USDA mortgage loan is currently serviced by Carrington Mortgage Services ( CMS ). CMS claims that the total amount past due is {$14000.00}. The alleged claim is for 14 payments. CMS alleges that {$3400.00} were transferred in late fees from XXXX. XXXX has advised there were no late fees compiled when the loan was transferred in XX/XX/XXXX. CMS is clearly trying to over collect on the amount due, so they can push the bill to the USDA for payment. I have also applied for a loan modification on numerous occasions and CMS has refused to submit the modification requests for underwriting to the USDA. Since the USDA is the investor and insures the loan, they would be issuing a partial claim to help fund the loan modification. Since the USDA is unaware of the partial claim, they were clearly in the dark on the loan modification process. CMS is in clear violation of the False Claims Act ( FCA ), 31 USC 3729 - 3733, since they knowingly withheld information and reported false records to a Federal Government Agency. CMS also has an obligation to process the loan modification with transparency and clarity per the National Mortgage Settlement of XX/XX/XXXX. CMS has refused to cooperate and has set a foreclosure sale date of XX/XX/XXXX. Based on the violations listed herein, I am seeking your assistance on this matter.\n",

Suddenly equifax will not let me log into my account without contacting a call center in XXXX and getting a password sent to my email from them. They sent me an email saying the issue was fixed. It is not fixed and Im tired of fighting with these people over my own social security number. This is a violation of fcra and my rights to lock me out of my own credit report. The person stealing my ssn is constantly doing this to save their own behind. Im tired of it and nothing is ever done. This has been going on since around XX/XX/2022 2022\n",

            "5. I don't recognize this account. I never applied for it. I was victim of Identity Theft, somebody stole my personal information to open credit cards. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.
