    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate a comment characterization algorithm for an online business. We will accomplish this using [Google's PaLM 2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2/) and [KMeans clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) in three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use PaLM2TextEmbeddingGenerator to [generate text embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/embeddings/get-text-embeddings) for each of 10000 complaints sent to an online bank. If you're not familiar with what a text embedding is, it's a list of numbers that are like coordinates in an imaginary \"meaning space\" for sentences. (It's like [word embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding), but for more general text.) The important point for our purposes is that similar sentences are close to each other in this imaginary space.\n",
    "2. Use KMeans clustering to group together complaints whose text embeddings are near to eachother. This will give us sets of similar complaints, but we don't yet know _why_ these complaints are similar.\n",
    "3. Prompt GeminiTextGenerator in English asking what the difference is between the groups of complaints that we got. Thanks to the power of modern LLMs, the response might give us a very good idea of what these complaints are all about, but remember to [\"understand the limits of your dataset and model.\"](https://ai.google/responsibility/responsible-ai-practices/#:~:text=Understand%20the%20limitations%20of%20your%20dataset%20and%20model)\n",

      "1. I decided to try XXXX services for my wife and I so I purchased phones for both of us. After a day or two of trial we felt unsatisfied so we headed back to the store and we returned all items. We got charged with restocking fees and taxes. Later on I got a bill in the mail in which I was being charged {$1200.00} for the returned items. After several attempts of arguing for about XXXX months about whether I owed XXXX or not I was dismissed of such charges, but a month after I was charged by a collecting company called ERC for {$61.00}. I asked them to explain such charges weather if they were fees or taxes and they we unable to disclose information. Therefore, I asked them to send me a bill in the mail with details about the charges, as well as a dispute package and they told me they would send me a bill. About the dispute part, they said that I needed to call XXXX to discuss the charges with them but XXXX said that I had to discuss this with the collecting company. I never received a detailed statement neither a chanse to defend my self about such charges, I checked my credit score and found a red flag in it because of this. \n",

      "2. Over a year and a half ago we started the process of buying a home. Our mortgage guy sent us to a credit repair co. They got the collection account from Weltman , Weinberg & Reis taken off my credit, because it was unverifiable. Now it is back on my credit. I have credit reports showing the trade line on and then off and now today it is currently on my report. When I called to verify the account with WW & R they sent me a heavily redacted letter verifying absolutely nothing. I would like this unverifiable account taken off my credit and removed permanently. This should not be a loan I have to pay for if there is no verification that it is my debt. Attached are the credit reports and the letter of verification that was sent to me.\n",
      "3. I recently disputed ( see attached letter ) with Receivable Management Services an account entry that they placed on my credit report without providing a dunning letter or any correspondence that would have allowed me 30 days to dispute the validity of the alleged debt. To date, I have not received any communication from them. They are blatantly violating my rights by reporting this inaccurate, erroneous, unverifiable entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, this account entry does not reflect a payment history which should be included on any entry that is reflected on my credit report. In my previous communication to them, I specifically requested that they provide an agreement that states their authority to collect on the alleged debt, agreement with signature of the alleged debtor wherein he/she agreed to pay the creditor, alleged account number, date this alleged debt became payable, original delinquency date, and to date to no avail. \n",
      "\n",
      "As such, since they have refused to respond to my request and not provide any documentation to substantiate their allegations, coupled with the fact that they did not provide me a dunning letter is grounds for this erroneous, inaccurate, unverifiable entry to be deleted from my credit report.\n",
      "4. I accepted service from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The company did not inform me that internet was required. They also told me that the agreement was at will without penalty. They never addressed my needs as a customer. My bill is only {$230.00}. They placed false information regarding my bill with a collection agency who has placed information on my credit report without contacting me or giving me an opportunity to dispute the validity of the debt. The debt is not valid. The actions are unlawful and I am requesting that the actions of this collection agency be reported to the Federal Trade Commission.\n",

I have been trying to get this removed because it was place on my credit report in error and inaccurate. ALL THREE CREDIT BUREAUS have continue to ignore the information proving this was place in error and fail to properly investigate the dispute I have place in their office. \n",

      "5. My Macys account is due on the first of every month. Since I have had the card I have paid on the XXXX PRIOR to the due date. And have paid over the amount due. In XXXX my XXXX XXXX auto pay did not come out of my account and rather than calling me - on the XXXX of XXXX just 5 days late they cut my credit off and shut me out of my account so I can not even see my credit profile - I have made the payment and they still are locking me out - please look into this - you will see that is what happened and they are stating in a letter it is becasue my XXXX report shows a seriuos derogorty item which it does not and I have submitted a complaint with them as well. Macys has been the worst credit experience of my LIFE and I did read the reviews but thought it would be different for me I guess? \n",
      "thank you for your help.\n",
      "comment list 2:\n",
      "1. I decided to try XXXX services for my wife and I so I purchased phones for both of us. After a day or two of trial we felt unsatisfied so we headed back to the store and we returned all items. We got charged with restocking fees and taxes. Later on I got a bill in the mail in which I was being charged {$1200.00} for the returned items. After several attempts of arguing for about XXXX months about whether I owed XXXX or not I was dismissed of such charges, but a month after I was charged by a collecting company called ERC for {$61.00}. I asked them to explain such charges weather if they were fees or taxes and they we unable to disclose information. Therefore, I asked them to send me a bill in the mail with details about the charges, as well as a dispute package and they told me they would send me a bill. About the dispute part, they said that I needed to call XXXX to discuss the charges with them but XXXX said that I had to discuss this with the collecting company. I never received a detailed statement neither a chanse to defend my self about such charges, I checked my credit score and found a red flag in it because of this. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am now hoping you may help me with this case. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks :\n",
      "2. Over a year and a half ago we started the process of buying a home. Our mortgage guy sent us to a credit repair co. They got the collection account from Weltman , Weinberg & Reis taken off my credit, because it was unverifiable. Now it is back on my credit. I have credit reports showing the trade line on and then off and now today it is currently on my report. When I called to verify the account with WW & R they sent me a heavily redacted letter verifying absolutely nothing. I would like this unverifiable account taken off my credit and removed permanently. This should not be a loan I have to pay for if there is no verification that it is my debt. Attached are the credit reports and the letter of verification that was sent to me.\n",
      "3. I recently disputed ( see attached letter ) with Receivable Management Services an account entry that they placed on my credit report without providing a dunning letter or any correspondence that would have allowed me 30 days to dispute the validity of the alleged debt. To date, I have not received any communication from them. They are blatantly violating my rights by reporting this inaccurate, erroneous, unverifiable entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, this account entry does not reflect a payment history which should be included on any entry that is reflected on my credit report. In my previous communication to them, I specifically requested that they provide an agreement that states their authority to collect on the alleged debt, agreement with signature of the alleged debtor wherein he/she agreed to pay the creditor, alleged account number, date this alleged debt became payable, original delinquency date, and to date to no avail. \n",
      "\n",
      "As such, since they have refused to respond to my request and not provide any documentation to substantiate their allegations, coupled with the fact that they did not provide me a dunning letter is grounds for this erroneous, inaccurate, unverifiable entry to be deleted from my credit report.\n",
      "4. I accepted service from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The company did not inform me that internet was required. They also told me that the agreement was at will without penalty. They never addressed my needs as a customer. My bill is only {$230.00}. They placed false information regarding my bill with a collection agency who has placed information on my credit report without contacting me or giving me an opportunity to dispute the validity of the debt. The debt is not valid. The actions are unlawful and I am requesting that the actions of this collection agency be reported to the Federal Trade Commission.\n",
      "5. I have continued to submit an investigation for a Bankruptcy place on my credit report. I have been trying to get this removed because it was place on my credit report in error and inaccurate. ALL THREE CREDIT BUREAUS have continue to ignore the information proving this was place in error and fail to properly investigate the dispute I have place in their office. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. They say they have verified this dispute with XXXX but I have a letter from XXXX stating this was removed because they were unable to verify the accuracy of the bankruptcy. I received this letter on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX just finished an investigation on XX/XX/2019 stating the verified this with XXXX. \n",
      "2.Experian Open the dispute on XX/XX/2019 and closed it on XX/XX/19 stated they verified with XXXX and the Bankruptcy court and I have a letter From XXXX stating they could not verify the accuracy of this dispute. I also, have a letter from the court house stating they do not verify information with the credit bureaus How could be this be on my XXXX file when XXXX has removed this item. \n",
      "3. XXXX open and investigation XX/XX/2019 and closed it XX/XX/2019 No way they properly investigation I have submitted all information to dispute the inaccurate information. Please do a proper investigation. \n",
      "\n",
      "XXXX, Experian, and XXXX please do a proper investigation under 611 of the FCRA thank you very much I have attached the letter proving this this is not on my XXXX consumer report and a letter form the court house stating they do not report information to the credit bureaus from the XXXX XXXX XXXX, Clerk of Court United State Bankruptcy Court on dated XX/XX/2019 I have summited it to the credit bureaus to be ignored. I have as for a description of my investigation by section 611 of the FCRA and the information from the investigation is inaccurate.\n",
