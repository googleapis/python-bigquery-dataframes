    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate a comment characterization algorithm for an online business. We will accomplish this using [Google's Embedding Models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models#models) and [KMeans clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) in three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use TextEmbeddingGenerator to [generate text embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/embeddings/get-text-embeddings) for each of 10000 complaints sent to an online bank. If you're not familiar with what a text embedding is, it's a list of numbers that are like coordinates in an imaginary \"meaning space\" for sentences. (It's like [word embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding), but for more general text.) The important point for our purposes is that similar sentences are close to each other in this imaginary space.\n",
    "2. Use KMeans clustering to group together complaints whose text embeddings are near to eachother. This will give us sets of similar complaints, but we don't yet know _why_ these complaints are similar.\n",
    "3. Prompt GeminiTextGenerator in English asking what the difference is between the groups of complaints that we got. Thanks to the power of modern LLMs, the response might give us a very good idea of what these complaints are all about, but remember to [\"understand the limits of your dataset and model.\"](https://ai.google/responsibility/responsible-ai-practices/#:~:text=Understand%20the%20limitations%20of%20your%20dataset%20and%20model)\n",

My complaint is on Consumer Financial Services XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FL XXXX I started doing business with Consumer Financial Services in XXXX. I purchased a vehicle and they where the fiance company. I eventually paid that loan in full and took a personal loan. I was having some life issues and was told I could borrow more if I put the title of my vehicle up for collateral. For each loan I took if I was going to be late on a payment I was cohearsed into refinancing the loan for cash anywhere from 50 to 1000. Each of the 25 times I did this I was told it was mandatory that I purchase life and disability unemployment insurance.

I was the emailed a form on XX/XX/XXXX from a XXXX XXXX and it stated on the bottom of the form that all claims need to be submitted to the creditor which leads me to believe as the consumer that the creditor makes the decision of the claim. I asked XXXX if the collections attempts could be on hold until the claim is resolved. I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX maybe earlier and was told that XXXX and XXXX where paid and my next payment would be XX/XX/XXXX. During this time frame I was not called.

OnXX/XX/XXXX I contacted CFS to see if I could refinance my XXXX payment at I was still recovering from the lack of money thru the disability I was told that I owe for XXXX and XXXX.

If I knew it was not mandatory I would not have purchased it 25 times. XXXX stated to me that he in fact credited me the XXXX payment so it would not effect my credit as a courtesy. He stated \" he credits the payment for long term customers and goes back in the next month and voids the credit ''. I don't know if this is illegal or just unethical. I think there could be a bias there. XXXX stated that he was going to call the insurance company and research this and call me back.

My complaint is on Consumer Financial Services XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FL XXXX I started doing business with Consumer Financial Services in XXXX. I purchased a vehicle and they where the fiance company. I eventually paid that loan in full and took a personal loan. I was having some life issues and was told I could borrow more if I put the title of my vehicle up for collateral. For each loan I took if I was going to be late on a payment I was cohearsed into refinancing the loan for cash anywhere from 50 to 1000. Each of the 25 times I did this I was told it was mandatory that I purchase life and disability unemployment insurance. So to get the loan I accepted it each time as it was a mandatory condition. \n",

I was the emailed a form on XX/XX/XXXX from a XXXX XXXX and it stated on the bottom of the form that all claims need to be submitted to the creditor which leads me to believe as the consumer that the creditor makes the decision of the claim. I asked XXXX if the collections attempts could be on hold until the claim is resolved. I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX maybe earlier and was told that XXXX and XXXX where paid and my next payment would be XX/XX/XXXX. During this time frame I was not called. I was contacted around XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX and told my XXXX payment was all that was due. OnXX/XX/XXXX I contacted CFS to see if I could refinance my XXXX payment at I was still recovering from the lack of money thru the disability I was told that I owe for XXXX and XXXX. I asked for a manager and spoke to a man who identified himself as the owner of the company. \n",

XXXX stated that XXXX should not have told me that and he was not honoring it. XXXX also told me the insurance that I was told 25 times that was mandatory is not mandatory. If I knew it was not mandatory I would not have purchased it 25 times. XXXX stated to me that he in fact credited me the XXXX payment so it would not effect my credit as a courtesy. He stated \" he credits the payment for long term customers and goes back in the next month and voids the credit ''. I don't know if this is illegal or just unethical. I think there could be a bias there. XXXX stated that he was going to call the insurance company and research this and call me back. I askeed XXXX if he could hold the collection process while we handle this dispute and he told me he would get back with me that day this was XX/XX/XXXXI believe. From then to now I have recived three calls a day and a email in regards to my account. I have emailed asking for XXXX to call me and have been unsuccessful. Today I spoke with a XXXX and she stated that The notes say that XXXX was not covered. I have aske d for XXXX to call me as I recived no correspondence to this matter. XX/XX/XXXX.\n",
