"""
This module is imported from the pandas package __init__.py file
in order to ensure that the core.config options registered here will
be available as soon as the user loads the package. if register_option
is invoked inside specific modules, they will not be registered until that
module is imported, which may or may not be a problem.

If you need to make sure options are available even before a certain
module is imported, register them here rather than in the module.
