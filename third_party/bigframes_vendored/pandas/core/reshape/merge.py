    Merge DataFrame objects with a database-style join.

    The join is done on columns or indexes. If joining columns on
    columns, the DataFrame indexes *will be ignored*. Otherwise if joining indexes
    on indexes or indexes on a column or columns, the index will be passed on.
    When performing a cross merge, no column specifications to merge on are
    allowed.

    .. note::
        A named Series object is treated as a DataFrame with a single named column.

    .. warning::
        If both key columns contain rows where the key is a null value, those
        rows will be matched against each other. This is different from usual SQL
        join behaviour and can lead to unexpected results.

    Args:
        left:
            The primary object to be merged.
        right:
            Object to merge with.
        how:
            ``{'left', 'right', 'outer', 'inner'}, default 'inner'``
            Type of merge to be performed.
            ``left``: use only keys from left frame, similar to a SQL left outer join;
            preserve key order.
            ``right``: use only keys from right frame, similar to a SQL right outer join;
            preserve key order.
            ``outer``: use union of keys from both frames, similar to a SQL full outer
            join; sort keys lexicographically.
            ``inner``: use intersection of keys from both frames, similar to a SQL inner
            join; preserve the order of the left keys.

        on (label or list of labels):
            Columns to join on. It must be found in both DataFrames. Either on or left_on + right_on
            must be passed in.
        left_on (label or list of labels):
            Columns to join on in the left DataFrame. Either on or left_on + right_on
            must be passed in.
        right_on (label or list of labels):
            Columns to join on in the right DataFrame. Either on or left_on + right_on
            must be passed in.
        sort:
            Default False. Sort the join keys lexicographically in the
            result DataFrame. If False, the order of the join keys depends
            on the join type (how keyword).
        suffixes:
            Default ``("_x", "_y")``. A length-2 sequence where each
            element is optionally a string indicating the suffix to add to
            overlapping column names in `left` and `right` respectively.
            Pass a value of `None` instead of a string to indicate that the
            column name from `left` or `right` should be left as-is, with
            no suffix. At least one of the values must not be None.

    Returns:
        bigframes.dataframe.DataFrame: A DataFrame of the two merged objects.
