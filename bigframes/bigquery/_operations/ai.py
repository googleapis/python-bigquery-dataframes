    Args:
        prompt (str | Series | List[str|Series] | Tuple[str|Series, ...]):
            A mixture of Series and string literals that specifies the prompt to send to the model. The Series can be BigFrames Series
            or pandas Series.
        connection_id (str, optional):
            Specifies the connection to use to communicate with the model. For example, `myproject.us.myconnection`.
            If not provided, the query uses your end-user credential.
        endpoint (str, optional):
            Specifies the Vertex AI endpoint to use for the model. For example `"gemini-2.5-flash"`. You can specify any
            generally available or preview Gemini model. If you specify the model name, BigQuery ML automatically identifies and
            uses the full endpoint of the model. If you don't specify an ENDPOINT value, BigQuery ML selects a recent stable
            version of Gemini to use.
        request_type (Literal["dedicated", "shared", "unspecified"]):
            Specifies the type of inference request to send to the Gemini model. The request type determines what quota the request uses.
            * "dedicated": function only uses Provisioned Throughput quota. The function returns the error Provisioned throughput is not
            purchased or is not active if Provisioned Throughput quota isn't available.
            * "shared": the function only uses dynamic shared quota (DSQ), even if you have purchased Provisioned Throughput quota.
            * "unspecified": If you haven't purchased Provisioned Throughput quota, the function uses DSQ quota.
            If you have purchased Provisioned Throughput quota, the function uses the Provisioned Throughput quota first.
            If requests exceed the Provisioned Throughput quota, the overflow traffic uses DSQ quota.
        model_params (Mapping[Any, Any]):
            Provides additional parameters to the model. The MODEL_PARAMS value must conform to the generateContent request body format.
        output_schema (Mapping[str, str]):
            A mapping value that specifies the schema of the output, in the form {field_name: data_type}. Supported data types include
            `STRING`, `INT64`, `FLOAT64`, `BOOL`, `ARRAY`, and `STRUCT`.

    Returns:
        bigframes.series.Series: A new struct Series with the result data. The struct contains these fields:
        * "result": a STRING value containing the model's response to the prompt. The result is None if the request fails or is filtered by responsible AI.
        If you specify an output schema then result is replaced by your custom schema.
        * "full_response": a JSON value containing the response from the projects.locations.endpoints.generateContent call to the model.
        The generated text is in the text element.
        * "status": a STRING value that contains the API response status for the corresponding row. This value is empty if the operation was successful.

            A str value that specifies the name of the data column. The data column contains the data to forecast.
            The data column must use one of the following data types: INT64, NUMERIC and FLOAT64
        timestamp_col (str):
            A str value that specified the name of the time points column.

        model (str, default "TimesFM 2.0"):
            A str value that specifies the name of the model. TimesFM 2.0 is the only supported value, and is the default value.
        id_cols (Iterable[str], optional):
            An iterable of str value that specifies the names of one or more ID columns. Each ID identifies a unique time series to forecast.
            Specify one or more values for this argument in order to forecast multiple time series using a single query.
            The columns that you specify must use one of the following data types: STRING, INT64, ARRAY<STRING> and ARRAY<INT64>
        horizon (int, default 10):
            An int value that specifies the number of time points to forecast. The default value is 10. The valid input range is [1, 10,000].
        confidence_level (float, default 0.95):
            A FLOAT64 value that specifies the percentage of the future values that fall in the prediction interval.
            The default value is 0.95. The valid input range is [0, 1).
        context_window (int, optional):
            An int value that specifies the context window length used by BigQuery ML's built-in TimesFM model.
            The context window length determines how many of the most recent data points from the input time series are use by the model.
            If you don't specify a value, the AI.FORECAST function automatically chooses the smallest possible context window length to use
