# This DBT Python model prepares and trains a machine learning model to predict
# ozone levels.
#   1. Data Preparation: The model first gets a prepared dataset and splits it
#      into three subsets based on the year: training data (before 2017),
#      testing data (2017-2019), and prediction data (2020 and later).
#   2. Model Training: It then uses the LinearRegression model from BigFrames
#      ML library. The model is trained on the historical data, using other
#      atmospheric parameters to predict the 'o3' (ozone) levels.
#   3. Prediction: Finally, the trained model makes predictions on the most
#      recent data (from 2020 onwards) and returns the resulting DataFrame of
#      predicted ozone values.
#
